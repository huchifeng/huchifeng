爱是恒久忍耐  
  
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clangin cymbal. 
我若能说万人的方言，并天使的话语，却没有爱，我就成了鸣的锣，响的cymbal. 
  
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and the understanding all my misteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could I remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
我若有先知讲道之能，也明白各样的奥秘，各样的知识，而且有全备的信念，叫我能够移山，却没有爱，我就不算的什么。 

And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to the burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing. 
我若将所有的赈济穷人，又舍身叫人焚烧，却没有爱，仍然与我无益。 

Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 
爱是恒久忍耐，又有恩慈；爱是不嫉妒；爱是不自夸，不张狂； 

Does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 
不作害羞的事，不求自己的益处，不轻易发怒，不计算人的恶， 

Does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 
不喜欢不义，只喜欢真理； 

Bears all things, believe that things, hopes all things, endures all things. 
凡事包容，凡事相信，凡事盼望，凡事忍耐。 

Love never fails. 
爱是永不止息。
